    <h2>WORKING EXPERIENCE</h2>

    <p>
      I used to work as a runner during the semester break. My intention in working is to earn more money and avoid boredom during the semester break. Alhamdulillah, I managed to become a runner with the help of my friend because she told me about this job opportunity. Working as a runner is not too easy and not too difficult. This is because I only need to deliver the goods and collect payment from the buyer. I just need to make sure that the item arrives safely and on time. Among the challenges of being a runner are traffic congestion while delivering goods, hot weather and heavy rain as well as the difficulty of finding the location of the buyerâ€™s home. However, it gave me experience and also a lesson to me in finding Halal sustenance.

    <h3>VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <p>
      I used to volunteer in the OPKIM (Operasi Khidmat Masyarakt) program. The program is organized by Kelab Pembimbing Efektif Rakan Sebaya(PEERS). This program takes place at Desa Alam Shah, Pasir Puteh, Kelantan. The program lasted for 2 days. Among the activities carried out is gotong-royong to clean the surrounding area of Desa Alam Shah, recreational activities with residents, learning activities with children and motivational sessions with parents and children. It is a meaningful experience for me because through this program, it can give joy and smile to the residents there.
