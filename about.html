        My name is Zul-Amirul Muhaimin Bin Mohd Zukri. I am 20 years old and a final semester diploma student at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Kelantan Branch. I was born on 28th February 2000 at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia in Kubang Kerian, Kelantan. I have five siblings and I am the youngest child in the family. I started pre-school at the age of 6 years old at a kindergarten. I went to primary school at Sekolah Kebangasaan Salor and I continued my studies at a secondary school, Maahad Muhammadi Lilbanin (MML).

        I want to tell you a little about my family. My family is quite large. My family consists of my dad, mum, three sisters, one brother and myself. Dad and mom are the individuals I love and respect the most in my life. My mum is an attendant hospital and my dad is an agriculture manager. Both of my parents are 57 years old. They have been dedicated their lives in raising the 5 of us and ensure that we become successful individuals in this world and hereafter. I thank God to have such great parents. My eldest sister is 35 years old. My second sister is 33 years old and my youngest sister is 32 years old. Three of them are married and have a happy family. My brother is 27 years old. He owns his own online business and he is still single. I am very thankful to God because my life is complete with the presence of them all.

        One personality trait that i have is that i am calm. I have never got into an altercation at school or at any other place for that matter. I do not get mad easily, which i think is a good thing because if i was a hot head then i would be getting into a lot of trouble. What i have noticed is that hot heads always have problems with other people that are hot heads so i'm glad that i am not a hot head. My other personality trait that i have is that i am optimistic. I'm just not a negative person even when i am upset or mad. There is always that one person in your group of friends that is negative and i hate it when they try and bring the whole group down. I always tell that one person to shut up and keep an open mind. Keeping an open mind about anything just makes you an overall happier person.

        During my free time, I always play online games. Among the online games I like are 'Mobile Legends', 'Dota 2', 'PUBG' and 'Valorant'. I usually play online games with my friends. By playing online games, I can add friends from all over the world because online games cover the whole world. Online games have been my hobby since I was little. However, I never neglected my learning sessions. I will divide the time to study and also the time to play. If there is an assignment that I need to complete, I make sure to complete it first before playing online games.
